# Virtual Assistant

Staying on track with nutrition should be as simple as asking a question, so we decided to upgrade Amazon Alexa's ability to answer nutrition related questions.

The goal is to make tracking macros with Hybrid Nutrition, or any nutrition service,
easier with the speach technology powered by Alexa. 

If you're not familiar with the alexa voice model or Lambda functions, read the [Ask Hybrid Skill Blog](https://www.notion.so/Ask-Hybrid-on-Amazon-Alexa-8e9d26ced15346c68f3d9186cc3a7142) and check out the references below.

## Dependencies
- Amazon Alexa
- Edamam Nutrition Analysis API

## Installation
- Download the code `git clone https://github.com/Hybrid-Performance-Method/ask-hybrid.git`
- The Preferred method of local testing and development is via the [Alexa Skills Toolkit VScode extension](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/docs/alexa/ask-toolkit/vs-code-ask-skills.html). 
- Create a developer account on edamam.com to get free API keys for the Nutrition Analysis API.

## Testing
- Commit changes to master and deploy your own development version of the skill from the alex skill plugin, or simply pushing to your own alexa master.
