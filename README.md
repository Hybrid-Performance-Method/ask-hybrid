# Hybrid Nutrition Virtual Assitant

Staying on track with nutrition should be as simple as asking a question, so we decided to upgrade Amazon Alexa's ability to answer nutrition related questions.

The goal is to make tracking macros with Hybrid Nutrition, or any nutrition service,
easier with the speach technology powered by Alexa.
